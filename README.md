# Allinews

## Introduction:

All-inews is a full-stack development project that aims to provide personalized news recommendations to its users through an Android application. 

The application has been designed with the Instagram flavor in mind and utilizes the Google Component Architectural MVVM pattern for an efficient and well-structured design. 

The JetPack navigation component has been used to create a convenient bottom bar and page navigation system.

To create a seamless user experience, the app includes swipe gestures for liking or disliking news articles that are powered by a third-party CardStackView (RecyclerView). 

All-inews also incorporates a Room database with LiveData and ViewModel to support local caching and offline functionality. 

Data retrieval is handled by integrating Retrofit with LiveData to access the latest news from the RESTful endpoint newsapi.org.
